1024x600

lower 300 is the field

each tile is 100x50 with red/blue border

Make sure each sprite is using center bottom as starting point before any translation.

VFX stuff does not follow above limitation. Just use screen pos on top left instead

any damage is done by component.OnAtkHit. If something must be done to attack target

to encourage players to juggle their weapon make sure to make the cooldown of initial weapon takes longer than the EN recovery.
We also encourage players to finish fast by putting stake and increase difficulties the longer the battle takes


Developer's note

To add more combat encounter, create CombatSceneDecorator function on combatscenedecorator.go
the signature is func(*ecs.ECS, *CombatScene)

then edit the stageselectscene.go file, on function GenerateLayout1 change

```
var LevelLayout1 = &Level{
		Root: &LevelNode{
			Id:            "0",
			Tier:          0,
			SelectedStage: NewCombatNextStage(nil),
			Icon:          assets.BattleIcon,
		},
	}
```

into

```
var LevelLayout1 = &Level{
		Root: &LevelNode{
			Id:            "0",
			Tier:          0,
			SelectedStage: NewCombatNextStage(<new function name>),
			Icon:          assets.BattleIcon,
		},
	}
```
