I cannot include the license for the assets (image, music, etc) due to some of them are from different source. I have added the source in the CREDITS file so you can go to them and see how each assets license works. I will release the assets to itch.io once I'm done with the game

As for the story, it's "do whatever you want with it as long as you credit the source" license. You can make any derivative works as long as you credit the source (this game).
